# Feel the Vibes: AI-assisted Coding

Like never before, research now builds on custom-written software, ranging from small analysis scripts to Python code that collects massive amounts of data via an API, and even advanced software that, in its own right, is the important output of research.

This is all great, but it also means that you, as the researcher, have to learn yet another skill to do your craft well and compete nationally and internationally.

Luckily, it has never been easier to write software, thanks to the immense potential of current generative AI models and their coding abilities.

In this workshop, you will learn both the basics of AI-assisted coding and the best practices that will help you write code together with AI with ease.

**Learn how to code more efficiently:**
Skip scouring the internet for days for a solution to your coding problem and instead use AI to help you find a solution in minutes.

**Write better code:**
Avoid the guesswork of what styles, frameworks, and packages to use by having AI suggest ways to produce robust and readable code.

**Donâ€™t go to jail:**
Avoid compliance pitfalls when working with AI, but also avoid being overly cautious and leaving a lot on the table.

**Learn more, get frustrated less:**
Avoid the most tedious tasks without outsourcing your thinking to AI, so you can become a proficient programmer faster than ever before.
