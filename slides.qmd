## 🤖 Using AI to produce software

\

::::columns
::: {.column width="48%"}
### ✨ Why is AI so good at Coding?

-   Lots of **code** and **documentation** online
-   Relatively clear rules
-   ... but it is truly amazing
:::

::: {.column width="4%"}

::: {.column width="48%"}
### 🦾 How well is AI actually doing?

-   LLMs can do more and more complex tasks
-   Reliability issues remain (more on that later)\
→ Crucial to **understand**, **tweak** and **test** *your* code

## 📝 Research Software Management

\

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Writing code is just the first step!

Make it FAIR with the help of good **Research Software Management**:

-   Version Control
-   Dependency Management
-   Add a license
-   Make sure it's reproducible\
→ Trustworthiness of your code

You can find an example project and a link to an checklist in the description.

## 🤖 The inner workings of LLMs

\

::: columns
::: column
### Tokens

-   Smallest unit of text for the model
-   Typically 3 - 4 characters
-   LLM = next token prediction
:::

::: column
### Prompt and Output Cycle

1.  Prompt is added to the end of the conversation
2.  Model is signaled to respond → Output

→ Prompts and Outputs = Context
:::
:::

## 🤔 Plain LLM VS Reasoning Models

\

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
### Standard LLM

-   Produces output token by token
-   All logic is applied ad-hoc and internally
-   Outputs are created based on the available *context*
:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
### Reasoning model

-   Have been trained to make use of an internal "scratchpad"
-   Allows the AI to
    -   make a plan
    -   temporarily store information
    -   explore different avenues
    -   re-assess potential answers
-   Can access the web

## 🕴 What is an Agent then? {.no-scroll}

\

::::columns
:::column
### General definition
Something that has ...

1.   **a goal**
2.   can take **actions in the real world**
:::
:::column
### Narrow definition

A meta-LLM that can ...

1.  call other **tools** (web search, Python, other LLMs)
2.  can access the command line and can write files

→ Allows autonomous workflows

## 🔀 Ways of coding with an LLM{.center style="text-align:center;"}

## 🔀 Chatbot

\

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
### ✅ Pros 

- Model choice
- Iterate on prompts
- Lots of control\
including which data you enter)\
→ *GDPR compliance*

### ❌ Cons 

-   Copy-pasting
-   No further automation
-   Only aware of the context you give it

### ✅ Pros 

-   Automation
-   Context-aware of your codebase
-   Different modes of interaction (autocomplete, chat)
:::

::: column
### ❌ Cons 

-   No control over what gets transmitted\
    → critical for GDPR and IP
-   Can get expensive for API calls

## 🔧 Prompt "engineering"

\

:::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
### 🤔 What to ask for

-   Mindset: Ask for advice, not for solutions
-   Either very broad or very specific
-   Ask for a battle plan
    -   Think in building blocks
    -   Assemble them yourself
:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
### 💡 How to ask

-   Tell it all it needs to know
-   "How do I do xyz?" instead of "Do xyz for me."
-   Be specific in your requirements (you can discuss them before with AI)

## 🤪 Quirks of LMMs

-   Vast experience in nearly every technology... 
-   But they haven't worked with any of them for a while
-   They are quick to draw conclusions from "faint" memory
-   Can't admit to not being sure about something
-   Tend to overcomplicate things
-   Quick to introduce redundant technologies\
→ Risk of technical debt

## 😎 Some alternative approaches

\

Proper coding skills still cannot be replaced by AI.

-   Visit courses, workshops and Coding Cafés
-   Look for a role model and their work
-   Articles and tutorials, e.g.
    -   vignettes of R packages with\
`browseVignettes(package = "PACKAGENAME")`
    -   Turing Way 
-   The developer's documentation

Documentation should always be your "True North".

    -   Hallucinations
    -   Lack of self-criticism
-   Plagiarism?

## 🔒 Working with sensitive data {.no-scroll}

\

::::columns
::: {.column width="48%"}
### Research often involves sensitive data, such as

-   Personal identifiable information (name, age, emails, ...)
-   Special personal data (medical data, ethnicity, ...)
-   Trade secrets, NDA-protected data
-   ...
:::

::: {.column width="4%"}
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
### Top ways of using AI with sensitive data 

1. Only enter metadata (column names, number of rows, aggregated data, etc.)
2. Synthetic data
3. Use specialized packages that run locally or in a protected cloud 
4. Use local AI models (e.g. JanAI)

- Spot "improvements" your code, that you did not prompt for.
- A chance to review the code, the syntax and style before accepting it.

## 🧰 Specialized packages

Rather than using the AI for your processing, look for specialized packages for a specific task.

-   More flexible
-   Safer
-   Often more accurate

Examples:

-  *Whisper* for accurate transcription of audio files.

-  *textwash* for anonymization of text data.


## 🏁 Using Projects

Projects are a fantastic aid in managing chats and using them mindfully.

-   Add specific context or media that ChatGPT will keep in its memory for future chats.
-   Better workflow for different projects with corresponding chats

# Pitfalls {.center style="text-align:center;"}

## ✂ Pitfall 1 - Taking shortcuts

<details>

<summary>Shortcuts often turn out costly in the end.</summary>

It is very tempting to just ask the AI to do a whole work package for you, especially when you are under time pressure. Even worse still, the code will probably work, which hides the potential cost in the long run.

The result is often code that doesn't fit the logic and style of the rest of your project, adds unnecessary dependencies or in some other way does not fit well into the bigger picture.

</details>

::: callout-tip
## Our Recommendation

Find a workflow that balances *efficiency* and *sustainability* and that works for you. Then stick to it.

![](images/pitfall_2.png){width="900" style="max-height:unset;"}
:::

<details>

<summary>Only ask AI to do what you could also do yourself.</summary>

The sustainable route of using AI is to not have it write code that you could not have produced yourself. This of course doesn't mean that you can't ask AI **help you** write that code!

::: callout-tip
## Our Recommendation

We recommend that you only (fully) outsource tasks to AI that are basically trivial for you.

The context in the example of ChatGPT

-   The system prompt

-   Custom instructions

:::

## 🌊 Pitfall 3a - Context window overflow

<details>

<summary>LLMs can only remember so much</summary>

Especially in longer conversations, you can quickly exceed the functional context window, which is often much less than the nominal ones (e.g., 10k words for ChatGPT 5).

This means that the model will forget what was said earlier, especially if it was somewhere in the middle of the conversation.

</details>

![](https://i.imgflip.com/a4v4gn.jpg){width="500" style="max-height:unset;"}

## 🐷 Pitfall 3b - Muddy the (context) water

<details>

<summary>A little context hygiene goes a long way.</summary>

Many of the advertised features, like "custom instructions," "memory," and "projects," boil down to adding extra context to the conversation history (aka context stuffing). In most cases, this is helpful and feels like genuine personalization that adds convenience. But it can also lead to strange outcomes when the AI can't quite decide which bit of the context is actually relevant at a given time. It can also change the behavior of the model in unexpected ways.

Unfortunately, all the extra context is typically hidden from the user, at least while chatting with the model. At the time of writing, however, most providers allow you to inspect, modify, or delete unwanted context fluff, albeit it being scattered across various corners of the UI. A quick web search or asking the AI of choice can typically help you identify and remove the culprits, though.
