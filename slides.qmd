# Best Practices

## üòµ Which model do I use? pt. 1

Thankfully, we no longer need to navigate different models for our tasks, thanks to GPT5.

![](images/choice_of_models.png){height="50%"}

-   Different models for different tasks.

-   4o series for writing/ planning.

-   o3, o4 mini and o4 mini high for coding and logical reasoning.

<details>

<summary>More about this</summary>

-   For a coding task, try using the o4 mini models first, they are much faster than o3.
-   If you think the o4 models are not able to achieve your task, go with o3- it is a bigger reasoning model that can go more in-depth (at the cost of taking more time)

## üòµ Which model do I use? pt. 2

![](images/GPT5.png)

-   Picks the appropriate model based on the task at hand!\*

<details>

<summary>\*More about this</summary>

-   GPT5 may not always do this. It is at best, using key words in your prompt to gauge task complexity (and deciding further course of action)
-   Sometimes it will think way too little and sometimes start reasoning about something it doesn't need reasoning for.
-   It is always an advantage to know a bit about the different models. This video tells you about them in detail and with use-cases.

##### With Git

-   Git keeps every change safe and rewindable
-   You can always fall back to a working version

## Using `git diff`

The command `git diff` tells you exactly what changed in your code.

::: callout-tip
# Using `git add`

Remember to use `git add <file_name>` **before** you use `git diff`. Git will only track changes for a file that is added to its system.
:::

::: callout-warning
# `git diff` and AI written code

-   Using `git diff` is crucial when using ChatGPT to write code.
-   Even with a near-perfect prompting, tt can change parts of your code that you did not intend on changing which makes things messy even with version control.

## üö´ How to (not) have it write code

::: callout-note
## üèÜ Golden Rule 1

**It is your responsibility to have enough context into the problem. The lesser context you have, the less effective it might be in the long run.**
:::

![](images/GPT5_context_1.png)

## Thus began the cycle of debugging ChatGPTs code

-   Code provided doesn't run locally:

![](images/GPT5_context_2.png)

-   Features that work in canvas fail in my machine:

![](images/GPT5_context_3.png)

## End result of such workflows

-   You end up debugging ChatGPTs code way more than you would like.

-   Takes longer overall (even if the start was quick)

## ‚úÖ How to have it write code

**1. Narrow the scope of the problem**

::: callout-note
## üèÜ Golden Rule 2

**Narrow and specific problems enable you to have more control and understanding of your own code and the AI generated code.**

## üìì Takeaways for AI powered code reviews

-   ChatGPT generally has very high standards (looks into both major and very minor issues) - be mindful of its feedback and gauge what is most useful for you.
-   Giving more context into the use-case of your code will help it better tailor its response for you.
-   Don't give yourself a headache going too deep into its feedback, its important to know that responses will vary even if the same prompt is sent again. Keep re-reading the first point until you are convinced üéà

## üèÅ Using Projects

::: callout-tip
## Using Projects

I have found using projects to be a fantastic aid in managing my chats and using them mindfully.

-   Add specific context or media that ChatGPT will keep in its memory for future chats.
-   Better workflow for different projects with corresponding chats
