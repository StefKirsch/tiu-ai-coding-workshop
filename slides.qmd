Open AI has a bunch of different models, and not the best indication of how to use them.

## üìù[**GPT 4 Series\*:**]{.underline}

***\*: Not including the new 4.1 models***

**Strengths:** Fast, Cheap and Multimodal

**Limitations:** Inability to execute complex tasks, Generic/ Unclear solutions

## üß†[**o3**]{.underline}

**Strengths**: Reasoning, Accuracy on complex tasks and Depth

**Limitations:** Limited availability, Longer response times

## üí®[**o4 mini high**]{.underline}

**Strengths:** Logic, Reasoning, Coding, Speed

**Limitations:** Smaller model, Inaccurate for more complex tasks

## Navigating coding models

*Try experimenting with the o3 model as a fallback!*

I always start out using o4 mini for my coding problems and see how well it does. If you run into its limitations very early on, that's a good sign that a larger model (like o3) is a better choice. This way, you also avoid exhausting your o3 limit!

## Using Projects

I have found using projects to be a fantastic aid in managing my chats and using them mindfully. They also allow adding a specific context or media that ChatGPT will keep in its memory for future chats. The organization does not have to be perfect, but it definitely helped my to organize my work flow a bit better (figuring out when to start a new chat, also having an overview of the types of questions that warranted a conversation with ChatGPT)
