# Best Practices

## 😵 Which model do I use?

Thankfully, we no longer need to navigate different models for our tasks, thanks to GPT5.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

-   Different models for different tasks.

-   4o series for writing/ planning.

-   o3, o4 mini and o4 mini high for coding and logical reasoning.

-   Picks the appropriate model based on the task at hand!

## 🏆 Golden Rule 1

**It is your responsibility to have enough context into the problem. The lesser context you have, the less effective it might be in the long run.**
:::

![](images/GPT5_context_1.png) **Thus began the cycle of debugging ChatGPTs code:**

-   Code provided doesn't run locally:

-   Features that work in canvas fail in my machine:

[**End result of such workflows**:]{.underline}

-   You end up debugging ChatGPTs code way more than you would like.

-   Takes longer overall (even if the start was quick)

## ✅ How to have it write code


**1. Narrow the scope of the problem**

::: callout-note
🏆 Golden Rule 2

**Narrow and specific problems enable you to have more control and understanding of your own code and the AI generated code.**

**2. Understanding code with it**


*brainstorm* with it on how to tackle problems.

-   Use it for advice on specific problems, with constraints, etc

-   Get satisfaction of solving a hard problem NOT by thinking of the solution, but understanding the solution and understanding why it's smart

-   Whats missing in your approach? Ask it to find flaws on what your current solution is. Judge its answer too.

-   Role call

-   Rubber duck- debugging method for programmers

## 🏁 Using Projects

## Using Projects

I have found using projects to be a fantastic aid in managing my chats and using them mindfully.

-   Add specific context or media that ChatGPT will keep in its memory for future chats.
-   Better workflow for different projects with corresponding chats
