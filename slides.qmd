# Best Practices

## ðŸ˜… How should I use ChatGPT?

Thankfully, we no longer need to navigate different models for our tasks, thanks to GPT5.

-   1\. Different models for different tasks.

-    4o series for writing/ planning.

-    o3, o4 mini and o4 mini high for coding and logical reasoning.

## Using it for writing

## Using it for coding

-   Use it to understand code.

-   Use it to brainstorm on how to tackle problems.

-   Use it for advice on specific problems, with constraints, etc

-   Get satisfaction of solving a hard problem NOT by thinking of the solution, but understanding the solution and understanding why it's smart

-   Whats missing in your approach? Ask it to find flaws on what your current solution is. Judge its answer too.

## Side note: Using Projects

## Using Projects

I have found using projects to be a fantastic aid in managing my chats and using them mindfully.

-   Add specific context or media that ChatGPT will keep in its memory for future chats.
-   Better workflow for different projects with corresponding chats
