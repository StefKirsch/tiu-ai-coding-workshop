# Best Practices

## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Which model should I use?

Open AI has a bunch of different models, and not the best indication of how to use them.

[**GPT 4 Series:**]{.underline}

***Keywords: fast, cheap, multimodal (include 3 screenshots- one for writing a draft of an email, one for planning work for a project, and the last one generating art for a thesis cover)***

-   Use the 4 series for tasks are easier to review and/or creative.

-   They are capable of multi-modal outputs (*think drafts of emails, TODOs, planning the week, generating images).*

-   The 4 series returns answers **very quickly** but also often lack accuracy required for more complicated tasks. Supplying it with tasks that require reasoning will very quickly backfire.
