# Best Practices

## 😵 Which model do I use?

Thankfully, we no longer need to navigate different models for our tasks, thanks to GPT5.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
🔴

![](images/choice_of_models.png){width="500"}

-   Different models for different tasks.

-   4o series for writing/ planning.

-   o3, o4 mini and o4 mini high for coding and logical reasoning.

::: {.column width="50%"}

-   Picks the appropriate model based on the task at hand!

## 🏆 Golden Rule 1

**It is your responsibility to have enough context into the problem. The lesser context you have, the less effective it might be in the long run.**

## Thus began the cycle of debugging ChatGPTs code

-   Code provided doesn't run locally:

-   Features that work in canvas fail in my machine:

## End result of such workflows

-   You end up debugging ChatGPTs code way more than you would like.

-   Takes longer overall (even if the start was quick)

## ✅ How to have it write code

**1. Narrow the scope of the problem**

::: callout-note
## 🏆 Golden Rule 2

**Narrow and specific problems enable you to have more control and understanding of your own code and the AI generated code.**

**2. 💡 Understanding code with it**

-   Breaking down unfamiliar code

-   Improving your own code base (pt1)

-   Improving your own code base (pt2) - *including use-case*

## 📓 Takeaways for AI powered code reviews

-   ChatGPT generally has very high standards (looks into both major and very minor issues) - be mindful of its feedback and gauge what is most useful for you.
-   Giving more context into the use-case of your code will help it better tailor its response for you.
-   Don't give yourself a headache going too deep into its feedback, its important to know that responses will vary even if the same prompt is sent again. Keep re-reading the first point until you are convinced 🎈

## 

*brainstorm* with it on how to tackle problems.

-   Use it for advice on specific problems, with constraints, etc

-   Get satisfaction of solving a hard problem NOT by thinking of the solution, but understanding the solution and understanding why it's smart

-   Whats missing in your approach? Ask it to find flaws on what your current solution is. Judge its answer too.

## Using Projects

I have found using projects to be a fantastic aid in managing my chats and using them mindfully.

-   Add specific context or media that ChatGPT will keep in its memory for future chats.
-   Better workflow for different projects with corresponding chats
